A simple slack app that sends out a poll to rate our concierge services.
The responses are collected in [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ip4fsMcLpvYVckzqA782rUaKazKAbIeGV_s5Jo0j8hQ/edit?usp=sharing) google sheet.

Usage:
1. type `/concierge @user_name` to any channel
2. the bot writes to the specified user with a request to fill the poll
3. the bot also sends you a message with the status of the poll
4. after the recipient answers the question, you can see their answer in the google sheet
